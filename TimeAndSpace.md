Time and Space
==============

It is said that an object at rest continues to stay in rest, unless acted upon by an outside force. It is universally recognized truth, however, that matter is never too long let alone.

All around there was gas and dust. Some places more, some places less. Some of it moved, some of it was still. Gradually over time, in certain places, the gas and dust collected into small clumps. These small clumps did swirl around each other in a circular motion. For matter, in all places and times, had a tendency to attract other matter, and so it was with the matter around here. Nothing could be more natural.

There is a certain potential in the isolation of things. The tendency, previously noted, to attract of things to attract things, contain a certain energy. When the matter moves closer to itself, this potential is released, one way or another, has some form of energy. In the case of the clumps which are forming, this energy caused them to heat up, and emit a certain kind of light. The tendency of gas to collect also put in under a certain strain or pressure.

As time went on, the clumps tended to merge one with another, and further increase temperature and pressure. As they spiraled into each other, the new larger collection of dust had a rotation that was a combination of its former parts. Even after it was formed, more dust and gas continued to fall into it.

As more dust become one with the larger and rotating concentration thereof, the temperature and pressure continued to rise. Looking closely, the gas was not one continuous entity, but made up of discrete units. As the gases heat increased, these small units moved faster and faster, and as the pressure increased, this units collided more and more, bouncing of one another. For, although matter has in general a tendency to attract, when energized, or brought to close, it would repel itself.

Time continued to pass. The units of the gas collided more and more violently. Two hydrogen atoms, colliding quite violently, however, did not bounce of each other. Rather, they become one unit, a helium atom. The helium atom had less mass than the two hydrogen atoms, and therefore the overall reaction caused a release on energy. This energy was intense heat and light.

Eventually, more and more hydrogen took place in this process. The energy so released increased temperature and pressure further. Eventually, this was so great as to balance out the collapsing and collecting of the gas and dust. It did not overcome though, for it is the collapse and tendency to collect of the dust that provides the temperature and pressure necessary for the hydrogen to combine. The forces, gravity and pressure, where at equilibrium. Matter tendency to attract has, temporarily, been halted.

Time went on, and much energy in the form of light was released from this region of space. Hydrogen continued to combine and release energy, and gravity kept it together. This light transfered energy into a few pieces of dust that never fell all the way in. Usually this energy would simply heat up the dust, but occasionally the light would go through many, unnatural transformations, such as energy in chemical bounds, or the motion of electrons. All energy goes to heat though, and so did the unnatural energies as well.

Eventually, the hydrogen grew less and less, as it fused away. This allowed gravity to take its course, and the matter attracted one more. However, this new increase of pressure caused helium to combine, further releasing energy, and halting matter's attraction once more.

As helium grew less, carbon would take its place, and then neon, and then oxygen, and then silicon, and then iron. It would seem that the gases temperature and pressure would prevent it from ever collapsing again, and that matter tendency to become closer would slow down over time.

Yet, when iron combined, it produced no energy, and so when silicon began running out, the star began collapsing again. This collapse became so strong as to overcome the ability of the particles in the gas to stay separate, then began to simply become closer together, regardless.

This renewed collapse, however, released energy of its own accord, in the same way that the original clumps of dust would release energy by simply coming together. The terrible happened: so much energy was released, that great amount of dust where thrust into the far reaches of space in a gruesome yet spectacular release of energy. Matter tendency to attract has been reversed. All around, matter was flying away from itself.

Was this the fundamental limit and fate of attraction? To attract, but due to unknown forces, be thrusted away after a certain period of time!

At the core of the star, pressure was great. Gravity two was great. Indeed, even the light, had a tendency to bend under its will, but it was never captured. At the core, it was becoming quite noticeable. Pressure was squeezing particles closer and closer in the core, in tandem with gravity. Eventually, something peculiar happened. The particles came closer than ever before. Light coming out of it was being slowed. Time and space where being warped into one another. And then, darkness. It emitted no more light at all. The light was falling into the core! Indeed, more and more particles fell in. It seemed that no pressure could stop this renewed and more fierce attraction, an attraction strong enough to stop light itself. All the matter was collapsing into a single point, a singularity, a perfect attaction! Time and space became so warped, that the future was bent into the inner ward direction. The only future was inside this singularity. Although much energy was released as it fell in, when it got close enough, the very energy itself was collected in, contributing to its mass. All the dust that survived the previous release of energy was now at a single point, overcoming all pressure and repletion.

No force in the universe could overcome this attraction of matter, the attraction to stop light and completely warp space and time. The attraction of matter is, indeed, the most natural of all forces in the universe.
