Discussion
==========

You are welcome to start discussions on the `Issues` page. You can also have discussions on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ChristopherKing42/Pride-Prejudice-AP-English-2015-201).

When you create an Issue, make sure to select a label. There are labels such as `question`, `bug`, `enhancement`, etc...

Contributing and Collaboration
==============================

Although these notes serve the purpose of organizing my thoughts, contributions and collaboration is welcome.

The easy way to contribute is to simply place an issue on the issue page, describing any errors or new content that could be added (and then I can edit them in).

If you would like to propose edits directly, simply go to a page and click the pencil to begin editing. To propose a new file, click `New file`. To propose a new folder, propose a file with name `FOLDER/FILE.md` where `FOLDER` is the proposed folder name. Proposed changes will prompt a discussion surrounding the edits. If they are good, I will sync them into the document. If you would like to work on your own version of the notes, click `fork` at the top of the page. Don't worry, you can still sync my changes at your discretion and I can sync your changes at my discretion. The term `pull request` means a discussion proposing the incorporation of a set of changes.

When editing, make sure to end lines with two spaces if another lines comes after it. Page numbers are of the form `(ChapterNumber.PageNumber)`. Make sure to end new the names of new files with `.md`. Base style off the current documents.

If you aren't sure what to contribute, check the issues page. I'll keep a couple of to-do's there.
